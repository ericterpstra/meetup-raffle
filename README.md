#Congratulations!  

You've stumbled onto the repository for **Eric Terpstra's \#MEMTECH Meetup Raffle Spinner (beta)**

Unfortunately, the clean, sensible code is in another castle :(

Come back another time for direction on how to install, modify, and run this yourself.

---

However, if you are feeling extra brave, you can probably get this running by doing and `npm install` in both the root and public folders.  Then a `node index.js` to start the server.

But wait! You'll need a Meetup.com API key, and you'll need to set the API Key string an environment variable called 'MEETUP' so it can be read by process.env.MEETUP. 
 
 Have fun! :D
